Description: This program can be used to refactor a Robinson projection world map,
        offered through the WikiMedia project, in several useful ways.  A
        flattened version of the map can be produced, or the map can be
        rotated to an arbitrary line of longitude.  Pinpoint marks can be
        added at specific coordinates, and the stylesheet of the map can be
        rewritten, giving full control over colours and other aspects of
        the map's appearance.
